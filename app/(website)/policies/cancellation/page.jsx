        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-4">
          <li>
            Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made
            immediately after placing the order. However, the cancellation
            request may not be entertained if the orders have been communicated
            to the vendors/merchants and they have initiated the process of
            shipping them.
          </li>
          <li>
            TruBuddies does not accept cancellation requests for perishable
            items like flowers, eatables etc. However, refund/replacement can be
            made if the customer establishes that the quality of product
            delivered is not good.

          <li>
            In case of receipt of damaged or defective items please report the
            same to our Customer Service team. The request will, however, be
            entertained once the merchant has checked and determined the same at
            his own end. This should be reported within Only same day days of
            receipt of the products. In case you feel that the product received
